/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a paragraph.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - paragraph: Full paragraph entity.
 *   Only method names starting with "get", "has", or "is" and a few common
 *   methods such as "id", "label", and "bundle" are available. For example:
 *   - paragraph.getCreatedTime() will return the paragraph creation timestamp.
 *   - paragraph.id(): The paragraph ID.
 *   - paragraph.bundle(): The type of the paragraph, for example, "image" or "text".
 *   - paragraph.getOwnerId(): The user ID of the paragraph author.
 *   See Drupal\paragraphs\Entity\Paragraph for a full list of public properties
 *   and methods for the paragraph object.
 * - content: All paragraph items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') }} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given child element.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 *   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
 *   classes:
 *   - paragraphs: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
 *   - paragraphs--type-[type]: The current paragraphs type. For example, if the paragraph is an
 *     "Image" it would result in "paragraphs--type--image". Note that the machine
 *     name will often be in a short form of the human readable label.
 *   - paragraphs--view-mode--[view_mode]: The View Mode of the paragraph; for example, a
 *     preview would result in: "paragraphs--view-mode--preview", and
 *     default: "paragraphs--view-mode--default".
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "preview" or "full".
 * - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the
 *   current user is a logged-in member.
 * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
 *   is an administrator.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_paragraph()

                  <p>Learn and apply cutting-edge approaches and gain insight into the most current animal production and environmental management methods. Animal production research is primarily basic science discovery that impacts production outcome. Faculty who participate in production and management research use both basic and discovery sciences in animal sciences applications. Research uses many economically important species and incorporates novel treatments based upon new science discoveries and management methodologies.</p>

                  <p>The goal of this nationally recognized program is to understand the fundamental processes in reproduction and improve reproductive efficiency, when desired, or control or prevent reproduction, when reduced fertility is desired. Research includes a broad range of species and incorporates whole animal experiments, cell and tissue culture techniques, and molecular biology and genetic studies. Students have opportunities to learn and apply a multitude of cutting edge approaches to gain insight into reproductive biology and to solve important problems in reproduction.</p>
