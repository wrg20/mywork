# mywork
A collection of my work

* Lando setup file for dev environment (.lando.yml)
* Presentation I gave at Champaign Urbana Drupal Meetup about distributions about 3 years ago (Opigno included) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K31xciDegmBq80GkcvVahUU17I0gfc8X/view
* I used the ITCSS (inverted triangle CSS) and BEM methodology for writing HTML and Sass with my Drupal 7 themes which fit nicely into the Drupal 8 paradigm. 
* I have used several different frameworks.  I have used many versions of the following frameworks like bootstrap, jquery UI, HTML5 boilerplate and  zurb foundation
* I have built varnish caching servers with APC, memcached which included selective cache purging and 3 GB of RAM to output up to 1 Million requests a minute as tested by apache benchmark for the State Universities Retirement System (page load times well below 100ms). 
* I have included a few of my custom migrations.  Some Drupal 7 to Drupal 7 and some Drupal 8 to Drupal 9
* Subtheme with variable preprocessing with DrupalSettings
